Be aware of yarn and include build steps in Dockerfile if present. Use dashboard
front end as a reference.

Provide volumes for databases and mount appropriate directories for adapter

Refactor docker-compose services - these really belong in
lib/orchestration/services/<service-name>/docker_compose.rb

Add a note to README to handle `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` in development -
unfortunately Rails ignores this value in development mode. (It's configured in
config/environments/production.rb)

Standardise on log formats - by policy or recommendation ?
